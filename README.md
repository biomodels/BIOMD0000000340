**Abstract:**   
Coagulation is an important process in hemostasis and comprises a complicated
interaction of multiple enzymes and proteins. We have developed a mechanistic
quantitative model of the coagulation network. The model accurately describes
the time courses of coagulation factors following in vivo activation as well
as in vitro blood coagulation tests of prothrombin time (PT, often reported as
international normalized ratio (INR)) and activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT). The model predicts the concentration-time and time-effect
profiles of warfarin, heparins, and vitamin K in humans. The model can be
applied to predict the time courses of coagulation kinetics in clinical
situations (e.g., hemophilia) and for biomarker identification during drug
development. The model developed in this study is the first quantitative
description of the comprehensive coagulation network.
